Functional and Non-Functional Requirements of an E-Ticketing System
The requirements for an E-Ticketing System are categorized into Functional (what it does) and Non-Functional (how well it performs).

I. Functional Requirements (What the System Does)
User Management:

Secure user registration, login, and profile management for customers and administrators.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict features based on user type (e.g., customer, organizer, validation staff).

Event/Service Management:

Ability for organizers to create, edit, publish, and schedule events (including capacity, dates, and venue).

Support for multiple ticket types, pricing tiers, and promotional codes/discounts.

Ticket Booking & Sales:

Real-time search and filtering capability based on criteria (date, location, category).

Real-time display of ticket/seat availability to prevent overbooking.

Secure checkout and integration with multiple online payment gateways.

Temporary reservation/hold functionality during the payment process.

E-Ticket Generation and Delivery:

Automatic generation of unique, secure electronic tickets (PDF, mobile) upon successful payment.

Tickets must include a unique identifier (QR code or barcode) for validation.

Instant delivery of tickets via email, SMS, or mobile application access.

Validation and Entry:

Ability for staff to scan the e-ticket QR code/barcode using a dedicated mobile application or device.

Instant verification of ticket validity, checking against fraud, cancellation, or prior usage.

Administrative Functions:

Processing of ticket cancellations, modifications, and refunds according to defined policies.

Generation of detailed sales reports, revenue summaries, and attendance tracking reports.

II. Non-Functional Requirements (How Well the System Performs)
Performance:

Response Time: Critical actions (search, booking, payment) must complete quickly (e.g., under 3 seconds).

Throughput: The system must handle high volumes of concurrent users and transactions, especially during peak sales periods (e.g., 5,000 bookings per minute).

Scalability:

The architecture must be scalable to accommodate sudden, significant increases in user traffic (e.g., handling a major event sale).

Security:

Data Protection: All customer and payment data must be encrypted (in transit and at rest).

Compliance: Must adhere to regulatory standards like PCI DSS for payment handling.

Access Control: Robust mechanisms for preventing unauthorized access and detecting fraudulent activity.

Reliability:

Availability (Uptime): The system must target high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime) to minimize lost revenue from downtime.

Fault Tolerance: The system must gracefully handle hardware or software failures with minimal service interruption.

Usability:

User Interface (UI): The booking interface must be intuitive and easy for customers to navigate.

Mobile Compatibility: The entire system (customer interface and staff validation app) must be fully functional and optimized for mobile devices.

Maintainability:

The codebase should be well-documented and modular to allow for easy updates, bug fixes, and feature additions without extensive redevelopment
